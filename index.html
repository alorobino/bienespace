        <p>ABOUT THE SPACES</p>
        <p>Bienespace builds tiny houses designed to turn the constraint of space into an advantage. The limit on space forces a reflection on what is
    truly important. It prompts us to cut out the less important and the pure distractions. The physical space inspires a mental space that better focuses on 
    what we truly value. Spaces are simple, uncluttered and clean. They encourage us to feel calm and positive. They inspire a feeling of connection 
    both to ourselves and to nature. Finally, they must deliver. They efficiently answer to all our needs and adapt according to the given situation - whether 
    home working requiring deep focus or having friends around to cook and relax - all while minimising our impact on the environment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>CORE VALUES</p>
        <p>Houses are built using natural materials, not only because it is healthier and reduces environmental impact, but because it looks and feels better.
    The physical and emotional contributions that we demand from a tiny house, as described above, requires good design combining functionality and beauty. A space
    must be built to last, not only for sustainability but for our own sense of attachment to it. Finally, simplicity is everything. </p>
         <br>
        <p>INSPIRED BY</p>
        <p>Mediterranean earthy tones and textures, simple luxury and sensuality. Japanese value of empty space and connection to nature. Scandi natural materials, capturing of light and
    sense of comfort. Minimalism's simplicity and cutting through to the essential, so soothing in our complex world. </p>
