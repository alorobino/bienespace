        <p>ABOUT THE SPACES</p>
        <p>Bienespace builds tiny houses which turn the space constraint into an advantage. The limit on m.sq forces a reflection on what is
    truly important. It prompts us to cut out the unimportant and the pure distractions. The physical space inspires a mental space that better focuses on 
    what we truly value. Spaces are simple and uncluttered and they encourage us to feel calm and positive. They inspire a feeling of connection 
          both to ourselves and to nature. Our spaces can help us be our best, most authentic selves </p>
          
          <p>And they must deliver. They answer to all our needs and adapt to any situation - whether 
    home working requiring quiet focus or having friends around to cook and relax - all while minimising our impact on the environment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>CORE VALUES</p>
        <p>Houses are built using <strong>natural materials</strong>, not only because it is healthier and reduces environmental impact, but because it looks and feels better.
    The physical and emotional contributions that we demand from a tiny house, as described above, requires <strong>strong design</strong> combining functionality and beauty. A space
    must be <strong>built to last</strong>, not only for sustainability but for our own sense of attachment to it. Also, <strong>simplicity</strong> is everything. </p>
         <br>
        <p>INSPIRED BY</p>
        <p>Mediterranean earthy tones and textures, simple luxury and sensuality. Japanese value of clean, uncluttered space and connection to nature. Scandi natural materials, capturing of light and
    sense of comfort. Minimalism's simplicity and cutting through to the essential, so soothing in our complex world. </p>
